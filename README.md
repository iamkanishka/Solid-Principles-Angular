# SOLID-Principles-Angular

In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin, first introduced in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns. 

The SOLID ideas are

1. The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. " In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

2. The Open–closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

3. The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."  See also design by contract.

4. The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."

5. The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions,  concretions."


The SOLID acronym was introduced later, around 2004, by Michael Feathers.

Although the SOLID principles apply to any object-oriented design, they can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.

# Single-responsibility principle
The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer programming principle that states that "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor."The term actor refers to a group (consisting of one or more stakeholders or users) that requires a change in the module.

Robert C. Martin, the originator of the term, expresses the principle as, "A class should have only one reason to change". Because of confusion around the word "reason" he has also clarified saying that the "principle is about people." In some of his talks, he also argues that the principle is, in particular, about roles or actors. For example, while they might be the same person, the role of an accountant is different from a database administrator. Hence, each module should be responsible for each role.


# the Open–closed principle
In object-oriented programming, the open–closed principle (OCP) states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification";  that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.

The name open–closed principle has been used in two ways. Both ways use generalizations (for instance, inheritance or delegate functions) to resolve the apparent dilemma, but the goals, techniques, and results are different.


# Liskov substitution principle
The Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called strong behavioral subtyping, that was initially introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1987 conference keynote address titled Data abstraction and hierarchy. 

It is based on the concept of "substitutability" – a principle in object-oriented programming stating that an object (such as a class) may be replaced by a sub-object (such as a class that extends the first class) without breaking the program.


# Interface segregation principle
In the field of software engineering, the interface segregation principle (ISP) states that no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.  ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them. Such shrunken interfaces are also called role interfaces. 

ISP is intended to keep a system decoupled and thus easier to refactor, change, and redeploy. ISP is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design, similar to the High Cohesion Principle of GRASP.  Beyond object-oriented design, ISP is also a key principle in the design of distributed systems in general and microservices in particular. ISP is one of the six IDEALS principles for microservice design. 


# Dependency inversion principle

In object-oriented design, the dependency inversion principle is a specific methodology for loosely coupling software modules. When following this principle, the conventional dependency relationships established from high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module implementation details. The principle states:

1. High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
2. By dictating that both high-level and low-level objects must depend on the same abstraction, this design principle inverts the way some people may think about object-oriented programming. 

The idea behind points A and B of this principle is that when designing the interaction between a high-level module and a low-level one, the interaction should be thought of as an abstract interaction between them. This not only has implications on the design of the high-level module, but also on the low-level one: the low-level one should be designed with the interaction in mind and it may be necessary to change its usage interface.

In many cases, thinking about the interaction in itself as an abstract concept allows the coupling of the components to be reduced without introducing additional coding patterns, allowing only a lighter and less implementation-dependent interaction schema.

When the discovered abstract interaction schema(s) between two modules is/are generic and generalization makes sense, this design principle also leads to the following dependency inversion coding pattern.
